# ESP8266 LIFX
LIFX emulator for the ESP8266 WiFi SoC. 

[Based on the code of Kayne Richens](https://github.com/kayno/arduinolifx)
Made Possible by the efforts of the [ESP8266 Community Forum](https://github.com/esp8266) and their port of the [Arduino core for the ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

Todo:
 * make the color transitions fade
 * support different LEDs (PWM outputs, LPD8806, ...)
